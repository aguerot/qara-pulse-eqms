# CODEOWNERS File
#
# This file defines who owns and must review changes to specific parts of the repository.
# GitHub automatically requests reviews from the specified owners when Pull Requests
# modify files in their assigned paths.
#
# How it works:
# - When a PR modifies files in a path, GitHub requests review from the specified owners
# - Owners must approve before the PR can be merged (if branch protection is enabled)
# - This enforces document control and ensures proper review of QMS changes
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Replace aguerot with your GitHub team name or username
# 2. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
# 3. Enable "Require review from CODEOWNERS" in branch protection settings
